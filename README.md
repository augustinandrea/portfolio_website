The main goal of the project is to create a portfolio website about yourself. We must format the website's code to be able to reduce down to size in a responsive design and use flexbox and media queries. There should be different sections and a personal works sectin that shows off all the things you have done.

Side note: One thing I was worried about I thought I should mention is that I put my picture in the "About Me" section instead of it as a hero image. I did this because my image was very, vertical, and it didn't look right as a hero image. So I took one of the photos that I took as the hero image, and then put the portfolio image in the About Me section. I mention this design choice because the assignment said to see the picture immediately, but this format looked more visually appealing and it made sense to have the photo in the section about me.
